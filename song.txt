"A Better Place, A Better Time"

So she wakes up
in time to break down
She left a note up on the dresser
and she's right on time
You don't know anything
right or wrong
I said I know
and she said so
I want to panic
but I've had it
so I go
you don't owe anything to anyone

But don't take your life
because it's all that you've got
you'd be better off just up and leaving
if you don't think they will stop

And when you wake up
everything is going to be fine
I guarantee that you wake up in a better place
in a better time
so you're tired of living
and you feel like you might give in
well don't
it's not your time

looking through the paper today
looking for a specific page
don't want to find her full name followed by dates
because when I left her alone
she made a sound, like a moan
"you're known by everyone for everything you've done"
fuck buying flowers for graves
I'd rather buy you a one way non-stop
to anywhere
find anyone
do anything
forget and start again, love
she said she won't go
and that's that
it hurts too much to stand by
you've got to stop and draw a line
and everyone here has to choose a side tonight
the moment of truth is haunting you
don't forget your family
regardless of what you choose to do
you can't decide
and they're all screaming "why won't you?"
I'll start the engine but I can't take this ride for you
I'll draw your bath and I'll load your gun
but I hope so bad that you'll bathe and hunt

Annie's tired of forgetting about today and always planning for tomorrow (tomorrow)
Annie says "The saddest day I came across was when I learned that life goes on without me" (without me)
Annie says "If everyone has someone else, then I ain't got nobody's love to save me" (save me)
Annie says "I think I'll pass away tonight, because it seems I'll never get it right if it's just me" (just me)
Annie says!

Annie says she wouldn't mind if they never find a cure for all her problems (her problems)
Annie says as long as she has someone near to make it clear she does not need to solve them (solve them)
Annie says "oh, this loneliness is killing me it's filling me with anger and resentment (resentment)"
Annie says "I'm turning into someone that I never thought I'd have to be again"

And when you wake up
everything is going to be fine
I guarantee that you wake up in a better place
and in a better time

and even if it was
I wouldn't let you go
you could run run run run but I will follow close
someday you will say "that's it, that's all"
but I'll be waiting there with open arms to break your fall
I know that you think that you're on your own
but just know that I'm here
and I'll lead you home
if you let me
she said "forget me"
but I can't
